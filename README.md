# Github Repositories Challenge

The goal is to allow the user to type the name of a GitHub user and display their repositories in a list. The user should then be able to filter the repositories by name and/or programming language. The interface should be responsive and follow the principles of good user experience. The official GitHub API must be used to obtain the repositories per user.

## Technologies Used
The following technologies and libraries were used to build this application:

- [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/): A React framework for building full-stack web applications.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/): A cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) : A superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to the language.
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/): A utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to style web applications.
- [Apolo](https://www.apollographql.com/): A comprehensive state management library for JavaScript that enables you to manage both local and remote data with GraphQL.
- [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/): manipulating JavaScript dates in a browser & Node.js
- [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons): A library of icons for React applications.

## How to Run the Application
To run the application, you will need to have Node.js installed on your computer. 
Go to [NodeJS web page](https://nodejs.org/es/) to download and install the program.

Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/zzezequiel/mvst-github-repository-challenge
```

2. Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000/.

## Future Improvements
Here are some possible future improvements that could be made to this application:

- Component Reusability: Implementing a more efficient strategy for reusing components across different parts of the application.

- GraphQL Query Structure: Establishing a structured approach for crafting GraphQL queries to optimize data fetching and management within our application.

- Text Scripts Data File: Creating a dedicated file to store text scripts used in components and querys, providing better organization and easier maintenance.

- Enhanced Search Functionality: Enhancing the search feature to enable searching by repository description or language.

## Feedback

It was truly a pleasure to develop this project as a test for MVST. I thoroughly enjoyed the process and the opportunity to showcase my skills. It was the first time I use Apollo and it made handling data a lot easier. With Apollo, fetching data from the GitHub API was simple, fast and secure. Plus, it helped keep everything running smoothly by managing data effectively. I will using it again for sure! I'm eager to dive into new projects, tackle fresh challenges, and continue growing alongside MVST.
